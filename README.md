this repo contains practiced solutions to all kinds of online programming challenges i've come across and are currently present on this hard disk..

websites like hackerRank, SPOJ, Project Euler, etc.. are included

Some help has been taken from online material. so, if any code matches, i don't take the ownership. 

Some codes might not be complete.

Majority of the code is self-made. 
Following codes were made using freely available online help (blogs,forums,original websites):
Sieves (algo's)
the codes inside 'c' folder

If any other code is found similar, i'll either update this myself, or give due credits (on being told about it by someone). 
But ownership is not a big issue here since these are just Code Snippets, not something like a cloned app or something.
