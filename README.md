:DISCLAIMER: 
Some codes might not be complete.
Majority of the code is self-made. 

Following codes were made using freely available online help (blogs,forums,original websites):
Sieves (algo's)
the codes inside 'c' folder

If any other code is found similar, i'll either update this myself, or give due credits (on being told about it by someone). 

Btw ownership is not a big issue here, is it? ..since these are just code snippets, not something like a stolen application or blueprint!
