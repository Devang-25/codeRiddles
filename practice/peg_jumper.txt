Problem

A boy wishes to cross a river that has magical properties.

Suppose that he is initially on the left bank of the river, at a designated starting point X.  He can leap a maximum of cap feet in any one go.

Imagine a straight line joining the starting point X to the destination point Y on the right bank across the river.  The distance between Xand Y is tot feet.

The magic of the river makes a wooden peg emerge every second, at a random point on this imaginary line.  These positions are given in an array pegs, indexed by time in seconds.  Thus, pegs[0] is the distance from X of the peg that appears at second 1, pegs[1] is the distance from X of the peg that appears at second 2, and so on.

When enough wooden pegs emerge, the boy can use them as support to cross the river.  Once a peg emerges, it will remain available for the entire duration of interest to this problem.

The goal is to find the earliest instant by when the pegs that will have emerged thus far are sufficient for the boy to cross the river.

Example

Let tot be 10, and cap be 4.  Let pegs be as follows.

pegs[0] = 2
pegs[1] = 4
pegs[2] = 1
pegs[3] = 9
pegs[4] = 7
pegs[5] = 5
pegs[6] = 8

Since cap is less than tot, the boy cannot leap across the river without using any pegs.

At instant 5, when a peg emerges at 7 feet, the boy can cross the river in three leaps: 4 feet (X to pegs[1]), 3 feet (pegs[1] to pegs[4]) and 3 feet (pegs[4] to Y).

Thus, the answer is 5 seconds!
