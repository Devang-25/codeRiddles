# "You have a 4 x 4 board with words. For example:
# A B G H
# O L L E
# E R T Y
# G E F Y

# You need to write a function that finds if
# a certain word exists in the board.
# The rules are as followed:
# 1. Each character needs to be close to one another
# (neighbor cell). For example:
# The function will return false for the word HERE
# but true for the word HEY."
