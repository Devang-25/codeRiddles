# You are playing a game with a n-sided fair die. After your first roll, you have a choice to either get paid the face value of the roll, or pay one dollar and roll again. You can continue to do this till you decide to stop. You need to calculate the expected value of this game.

# So for a 6 sided die, assume the first roll is 2. You can either get paid $2 and stop playing or pay $1 and roll again. If you choose to roll again and the next roll is 4. If you stop playing now, you earn $3 ($4 - $1), or you can choose to pay $1 more, and continue. What is the expected value of the game, if you were to play it optimally.


def getExpectedValue(n):
