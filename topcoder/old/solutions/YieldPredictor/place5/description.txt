I models this problem as a recommendation system. And I try to solve this problem by using Matrix Factorizing and  SVD++ Feature.
The basic idea is considering the MaterialID as the user and the LOCCD*year as the item. Let the yields be the rating that the user rated for the item.
So we have a training set and the goal is to predict the ratings in the test set.
In my final approach, the training phase has two parts.

 1.  The first is to calculate the best training round. I split the origin train set into two sets such that the bigger one for pre-train and the smaller one for cross validation.
 2.  And then, put the two parts together, training them by SVD++ Feature Model.

That's how my solution works.
And  all the parameters in my program are set by myself adjusting by the submission returns and the experience I have got before.
