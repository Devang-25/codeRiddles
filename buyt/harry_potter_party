Harry is planning a party for all of his friends at Hogwarts. Each friend has their own liking/disliking for different dishes. For each friend, we are given a string of 1 and 0 where 1 shows that this person like this particular dish. Harry has N friends and a total of K dishes available to make his menu. You need to find the count of minimum dishes so that all of the N friends are happy, which means everyone has at least one dish they like.

Input : Input will contain T test cases and each of the test case has following description : First line of test case has numbers N and K separated by a space. It is followed by N lines each of length K . Each of the N lines contains a string consisting of 0 and 1 where if jth (1<=j<=K) value in ith line (1<=i<=N) is set 1, it means that dish number j is liked by ith friend.
